In July 2021 this execution was set to fail as the purpose was to verify
that the laser was behaving when the laser was aligned with the optical
axis of the optics. We realized that there was a problem of reflectors
visibility and therefore had to make a mechanical change to how we will
mount the laser in the cell. The mount will be at 45 deg and the tests
will be repeated with the nominal position being tilted.

\subsection{Overall Assessment}
\label{sect:overallassessment}

{As a result of the Factory acceptance testing, the overall test can be
considered a PASS. The test cycle was updated with additional tests that
were a subset of tests that were initially done in March 2020. The tests
that were done in July 2021 were able to address some of the problems
that were seen as part of these initial tests and were seen to be passed
as part of the latest test event. }

\label{sect:detailedtestresults}

\subsection{Test Cycle LVV-C150 }

Open test cycle {\it \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testrun/LVV-C150}{T2SA Factory Acceptance Test}} in Jira.

Test Cycle name: T2SA Factory Acceptance Test\\
Status: Done

This covers the verification of the interface between the Spatial
Analyzer software that controls the laser tracker and the Commandable
SAL Component called the Alignment System Controller.\\
This is executed by the vendor, New River Kinematics, with our
assistance.

\subsubsection{Software Version/Baseline}
Not provided.

\subsubsection{Configuration}
{In March 2020, the T2SA Acceptance tests were initially executed with
the laser tracker in a vertical position. The initial tests were put on
hold due to the pandemic so the tests were continued in July 2021.
However, when the tests were continued in July, it was discovered that
the laser had a hard time reaching the retroreflector on the camera
while parallel to the optical axis of M1M3. As a result, the laser
tracker was reconfigured with a 45 deg tilt and a subset of the initial
verification tests that were done in March 2020 were repeated in July
2021 with the new configuration. }

\subsubsection{Test Cases in LVV-C150 Test Cycle}

\paragraph{ LVV-T1816 - Measurement with the laser set up horizontally }\mbox{}\\

Version \textbf{1}.
Open  \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testCase/LVV-T1816}{\textit{ LVV-T1816 } }
test case in Jira.

The objective of this test will be to verify the calibration of the
laser holds whenever the orientation changes. Because the laser will be
part of the M1M3 mirror cell, it is expected to change orientation
several times during the night. This is mostly important for the tests
that we want to conduct during the commissioning phase.

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\
The commands and interfaces have been successfully tested with the laser
in a vertical position.

Execution status: {\bf Pass w/ Deviation }

Final comment:\\In July 2021 this execution was set to fail as the purpose was to verify
that the laser was behaving when the laser was aligned with the optical
axis of the optics. We realized that there was a problem of reflectors
visibility and therefore had to make a mechanical change to how we will
mount the laser in the cell. The mount will be at 45 deg and the tests
will be repeated with the nominal position being tilted.

everything, but since we moved the cart between measuring with the

Blocking an SMR did not cause the system to generate the expected error.
Instead, it caused a dialog to pop up on the SA host, which must be
manually clicked. However, this step is considered blocked because this
issue is due to the fact that the system is waiting until it receives
spatial information from at least 3 SMR's. Therefore, Scott will address
this with a coding workaround so that the system recognizes one of the 3
SMR's has been blocked and generates an error as expected.~

test case in Jira.

In this test case we will move the targets in different direction and
record the results of the motion\\
- motion in y (vertical)\\
- motion in z\\
- rotation along y\\
- rotation along z\\[2\baselineskip]We can conduct the test with the
laser both in a vertical position and a horizontal position

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\
The following parameters have to be adjusted:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  SET\_DRIFT\_TOL should be set to a higher value to allow the motion of
  the order that are allowed in the tunnel
\item
  SET\_NUM\_ITERATIONS to 1
\item
  SET\_NUM\_SAMPLES to 3
\item
  Randomization on
\item
  Power-lock off
\end{itemize}

Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\The results of this test execution were captured while the laser tracker
was set up in a vertical position. These steps were repeated when the
laser tracker was reconfigured with a 45degree tilt in the \emph{Testing
of the T2SA with the laser tracker at 45 degrees} test case.

{\footnotesize
It was initially seen from the \emph{Position Measurement of M1M3, M2
and the camera} test done in March 2020 that using three total SMR's for
this test impacted our ability to verify the error code. However, the
vendor introduced a workaround in the code to allow for us to verify
that an error could be provoked using only three SMR's. As a result, we
received ERR-326 ``Fail Least Squares Best Fit''. Although this was not
the expected result, this step was still seen as an initial pass because
this is the expected error when the laser tracker can only detect 2
total SMR's. The laser tracker expects to detect a total of 12 total
SMR's so ERR-305 would only be given when there are 11 SMR's detected

At the time of the test, it wasn't clear how the GEN\_REPORT command was

report without initially specifying a name and so this step was skipped
because the T2SA automatically generates a name for any report missing
one. This step will need to be revised so that it is clear we are
testing that trying to specify an incorrect report name will result in
the expected error.~
